Order for 'source xyz':
1. project_schema2.sql
2. project_data.sql
3. project_fk.sql

project_fk.sql exists because otherwise mysql gets mad about foreign keys (relatable)


Errors like this appear when using files:

ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`PFMonsters`.`#sql-2cf_9`, CONSTRAINT `fk_typename` FOREIGN KEY (`TypeName`) REFERENCES `CreatureType` (`TypeName`))
mysql> select * from Creature;

I think this is because not all the (potential) foreign keys from the referenced table get used as the tables themselves seem fine.
